# Inverse-effectiveness-paper
This is all code necessary to replicate the calcium imaging analysis for our Elife paper, "A Cellular Mechanism for Inverse Effectiveness in Multisensory Integration"
This code is predicated on using a separate code, written by Chris Deister (https://github.com/cdeister/imageAnalysis_gui) to extract the raw frame by frame mean fluorescence data from each cell. 
This code requires the raw data file tadpole_all_IEpaper, which is included in the paper's supplement. 
Once tadpole_all_IEpaper is open in Matlab, the code in this repository will generate the graphs in figure 1 of the paper.

If you would like access to the raw image files, I am happy to provide them. I am working on getting them into a repository.
